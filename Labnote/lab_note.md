The initial introduction of D3, Javascript and SVG has more or less finished, and now I need to go for advanced level of D3 those days.
The recent work highlight:

* Check the time scedule with Lukas
* Upload the project plan by monday  
* Figure out the Chart bar code of svg in d3.

Problem: .selectAll("rect") null

Solution: src="https://d3js.org/d3.v3.min.js" or cannot .attr all together

* circle use cx, cy. Rect use "x", "y".
* rbg need to be math.round
  "rgb(" + Math.round(d * 10) + ", 7, 26)";

*SVG element*
  "circle"- cx, cy, r ; "rect"- x,y,w,h

Scale function for x
  var xScale = d3.scale.linear()                     
                .domain([0, d3.max(dataset, function(d) { return d[0]; })])                     .range([0, w]);

for y
    var yScale = d3.scale.linear()                     
                .domain([0, d3.max(dataset, function(d) { return d[1]; })])                     .range([0, h]);

Revise the project plan, need to hand up Monday.

Start reading the Charpter 8 of Interactive book. Realize that for the expression data image, python will be needed.

New d3 function: .call()

The differences from .enter

    D3â€™s call() function takes the incoming selection , as received from the prior link in the chain, and hands that selection off to any function.

 So either:
  var xAxis = d3.svg.axis()
      .scale(xscale)
      .orient("bottom");
    svg.append("g")
    .call(xAxis);

Or
    svg.append("g")
    .call(d3.svg.axis()
    .scale(xScale)
    .orient("bottom")
    )

The differences between SVG code and CSS code

CSS:
    p {    color: olive; }

SVG
    text {    fill: olive; }

Talked with Gustavo about his codes in Guthub.

As the conclusion: three major tasks can list as their difficulties:

* Connect the python plot with Json data in Javascript. (Or alternatively, just create plot in D3 geomapping)
* plot
* Pathway diagram.

Two things need to be settled as priority:  Look into spaital plot python file; Download data from reactome and ST website.

Questions due to the py file:

* gene_name_start = "ENSG0"
* Hugo2Ensembl2Reactome_All_Levels.txt

Try to intalling anaconda

----
#### 2018-3-21  

Running Gustavo's overlaid image's python code (modified to only access one tissue section).

Unknown error result in no image output. Trying to find solution by adapting the code.

Thinking to use ST view in spatialTranscriptmic website as well.

----
#### 2018-3-22

Continue debugging the  overlaid image's python code (STviewer.py)

Suspect the memory error problem may due to two factors:

* python 32bit instead of 64bit. Solution: reintalling python

* may caused problem by package scipy griddata. solition: looking into package tutorial.

STviewer.py successfully run, still need to adapt into multiple * tissue sections* and multiple pathways (up to 2000).

----
#### 2018-3-23

Set up desktop due to the lacking of RAM and desk storage of my laptop.

----
#### 2018-3-26

The gene express map has successfully yield last week.

Will try to add probe point according to Lukas suggestion.

And will try to plot the map in d3.(2 days limit, if not possible then give up)

----
#### 2018 -3-28

d3 plots of gene expression seems good: <plot.html>, the script has been successfully shows the csv table has transform into svg in HTML

Two job remaining at the moment:
git config --global user.email "you@example.com"
* figure out the scale of colorScale

 overlay the tissue image.

 And ask Lukas about the detail demands of interface.

----
#### 2018-3-29

Found out the scaling function of d3 is not really suitable for overlapping svg to jpg, since it will resize the x,y coordinates.

Use the original size (svg:10000*10000) to match with the tissue jpg file,  the overlapping is just adjust by html(css).  However, unknown error conduct the lapping has deviation.

Now the primary job is to resize the html size to a reasonable range. Then try to fit in multiple svg data into the webpage.

The shift of multiple svg data remaining undone.

----
#### 2018-4-03

Trying to continue figuring out the shift between to svg data.

----
#### 2018-4-04

The transition(shift) in the d3 webpage for two sets of pathway data has been finished.

Now the job comes to adapt the whole databases into the diagram.

----
#### 2018-4-05

Fixed an error call on the console due to the misplace of .on strings.

----
#### 2018-4-09

Set up desktop, ready to run large datasets in the codes.

Conclusions after the meeting:

* add tool tip in the svg layer to indicate the pcomp.

* tell the scale about color

* two views (subburst; node trees) combination.

----
#### 2018-4-10

Desktop crashed during uninstall python2.

----
#### 2018-4-11
Due to the repair of desktop, the treatment of large datasets need to be delay.

Instead, I start to look into the code of sunburst and node-tree plot first.
I am also trying to separate the .css, .js and .html in order to make the script easy readable.

Found out I need to build up the json data, which shows the hierarchical relationship as well as q value of pathways. Thus, will find a way to build up this data, either use d3.hierarchy or python code.

----
#### 2018-4-12 to 2018-4-16

Spend several days to treat series of datasets in order to creat the json matrix of sunburst diagram.

The final version of json matrix contains of three columns: Pathways; Ngenes; explained_ratios. The explained_ratios will be erplaced be other factors when any quality value is avaliable. However, it seems a description of each pathway can be good to include into the matrix. Moreover, there should some tags in the matrix that can link the sunburst diagram to double layer plots.

----
#### 2018-4-17

Trying to build up the js code for sunburst diagram. The partition of each arc is based on  the number of genes size, and the color scale is base on the explained_ratios, the reatio number of each pathway did not really indicate desired info, so the color distriburion of diagram did not really shows the expression level of each pathway in the tissue.

Another question is the zoomable view is not functioned in the html view for some reason.

----
#### 2018-4-18

Stuck in the zoomable view of sunburst diagram.

the desktop has finished repairement, setting up and transfer the files from laptop to desktop.

----
#### 2018-4-19

figure out the zoomable problem, bug happens at the
    var partition
part, due to unknown reason,there is .size string in the function which should not happen.

Now I meet another problem is the sunburst diagram has some logical problem itself, detailly say: when children has some overlap part of genes, thier sum up of ngenes will larger than the parent's ngenes. In order to figure out this bug in javascript, I think I need to try d3.v4 and adapt rest part of code into this version as well.

----
#### 2018-4-20

Figured out the unarrange of nodes problem by switch the code format from d3v3 to d3v4, and also the lengend has been added to the plot.

Created a fade away function, so when mouse point over certain arc position, other arcs will fade away.

----
#### 2018 -4-23

Shows the sunburst diagram in the meeting, however Lukas was more concerning about the "data update" part of my project.

Although  how this data update function will avhieve still remine unclear in detail, but generally I will create large frame of codes that can calls Gus' codes, combine with my part of code and then execute to generate the both plots.

----
#### 2018 -4-23

Still think to build up a node tree vision of hierarchy data, but modified codes will take time

Then apart from this, the major task for now is
 * combine sunburst with double layer plots.
 * Data update.

----
#### 2018 -4-24 -2018-4-25

Temporary gave up in node tree version of hierarchy view since there is no significant use for this at present, I may redo it after major tasks of project finish.

Embed the histological image into the sunburst script, which takes more time then expect, the interaction between .json and .jpg can be difficult due to the lmitation of javascript.

----
#### 2018 -4-26

Finish write the script for the new version of sunburst viewer, the new version embed the histological image in the same webpage with the original subburst svg, and both of them shifts when selecting different experiment sets.

Now the work move on to the pathway expression plot, the original script of that part need to be modified so that it can interate with the sunburst script.

----
#### 2018 -4-27  

Try to regulate the script of double layer plot, meet some problem of data implement. And the other task for this part is add tooltip in each probe points.

On the same time, trying to generate the massive database of pathway express databases from differnt experiment sets. In order to achieve this, prevoius python code need to be modified.

----
#### 2018 -4-30

Rewrite the sunburst_json code: embed the 'id' column into json file so hopefully it can recognize the pathway expression matrix in the script.

The double plot script has also finish modified, waiting for the finish of massive dataset generation complete then I can test.

Lukas advise I can use 'event' to interact two scripts (specificly between sunburst script and pathway expression script).

The datasets generation takes more time then expect, after simplify the code, it takes appromixlty 20 hours to generate 2000 pathway matrix.

----
#### 2018 5-1

Spend time write project plan second part.

The pathway dataset of MOB_Rep1 and layer1_BC has been generated.

----
#### 2018-5-2

Find a big bug about the prvious code: the MOB stands for mouse brain cell, however the previous filter function in the code were using human pathway databases all the time.

So filter function and files need to be change, dataset need to be regenerate.

It will be better to separate the code between human and mouse cells, and the key file: hugo2ensembl.txt need to be redownload based on mouse pathway databases.

----
#### 2018-5-7

Leave the pathway definetion problem Temporarily since its not really part of the job for this project, will retutrn to this question if there is extra time.

Continue working on the combination of to js files. Found out event listener function is not really suitable for this case, neither jquery is working.

----
#### 2018 -5-8

New found is that the function is different .js file can actully being used mutually, which means when one js file has one function(e.g datapick), the other js can call this function as well if they are under the same html page. (tip: better use the same d3 version for both js file).

And Realized it is also important to separate the functions in code instead of net them:

Instead of :

    function foo(a, b) {
    function bar() {
        return a + b;
    }

    return bar();
    }

    foo(1, 2);

Its better choose:

    function foo(a, b) {
    return bar(a, b);
    }

    function bar(a, b) {
    return a + b;
    }

    foo(1, 2);

This method can help reduce CPU cost, accerlarate the loading speed.

Finished combination work, eventually, everything seems works fine.

Except from there is some bug in sunburst plot, when click really some children pathway, the radius cannot close itselves.

----
#### 2018-5-14

get some feedback from lask week's fika session, working on improving ux at present.

Add the overall search function for the sunburst diagram.

----
#### 2018-5-15

Find out the reason of THE BUG, according to the book:

      newer transitions interrupt and override older transitions. Clicking the bars initiates one transition. Immediately mousing over a bar interrupts that initial transition in order to run the mouseover highlight transition we specified earlier. The end result is that those moused-over bars never make it to their final destinations.
      But donâ€™t worry. This example is just a good argument for keeping hover effects in CSS, while letting D3 and JavaScript manage the more visually intensive actions.

add the reset function by re interplot the diagram in reset function.

----
#### 2018-5-17

Changed the color scheme of both svgs (sunburst and overlap plot).

Removed the fade away function in d3 script, add up a hover function (to bounce up certain arc) by using css. That aviod animation crashed for d3.

Thinkinf about add a function that can let users choose several differnt color scheme by themselves.

----
#### 2018 -5-18

Add up the function to change the colorways of sunburst in webpage. (between green and orange).
