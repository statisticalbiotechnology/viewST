The initial introduction of D3, Javascript and SVG has more or less finished, and now I need to go for advanced level of D3 those days.
The recent work highlight:

* Check the time scedule with Lukas
* Upload the project plan by monday  
* Figure out the Chart bar code of svg in d3.

Problem: .selectAll("rect") null

Solution: src="https://d3js.org/d3.v3.min.js" or cannot .attr all together

* circle use cx, cy. Rect use "x", "y".
* rbg need to be math.round
  "rgb(" + Math.round(d * 10) + ", 7, 26)";

*SVG element*
  "circle"- cx, cy, r ; "rect"- x,y,w,h

Scale function for x
  var xScale = d3.scale.linear()                     
                .domain([0, d3.max(dataset, function(d) { return d[0]; })])                     .range([0, w]);

for y
    var yScale = d3.scale.linear()                     
                .domain([0, d3.max(dataset, function(d) { return d[1]; })])                     .range([0, h]);

Revise the project plan, need to hand up Monday.

Start reading the Charpter 8 of Interactive book. Realize that for the expression data image, python will be needed.

New d3 function: .call()

The differences from .enter

    D3â€™s call() function takes the incoming selection , as received from the prior link in the chain, and hands that selection off to any function.

 So either:
  var xAxis = d3.svg.axis()
      .scale(xscale)
      .orient("bottom");
    svg.append("g")
    .call(xAxis);

Or
    svg.append("g")
    .call(d3.svg.axis()
    .scale(xScale)
    .orient("bottom")
    )

The differences between SVG code and CSS code

CSS:
    p {    color: olive; }

SVG
    text {    fill: olive; }

Talked with Gustavo about his codes in Guthub.

As the conclusion: three major tasks can list as their difficulties:

* Connect the python plot with Json data in Javascript. (Or alternatively, just create plot in D3 geomapping)
* plot
* Pathway diagram.

Two things need to be settled as priority:  Look into spaital plot python file; Download data from reactome and ST website.

Questions due to the py file:

* gene_name_start = "ENSG0"
* Hugo2Ensembl2Reactome_All_Levels.txt

Try to intalling anaconda

Running Gustavo's overlaid image's python code (modified to only access one tissue section).

Unknown error result in no image output. Trying to find solution by adapting the code.

Thinking to use ST view in spatialTranscriptmic website as well.

Continue debugging the  overlaid image's python code (STviewer.py)

Suspect the memory error problem may due to two factors:

* python 32bit instead of 64bit. Solution: reintalling python

* may caused problem by package scipy griddata. solition: looking into package tutorial.

STviewer.py successfully run, still need to adapt into multiple * tissue sections* and multiple pathways (up to 2000).

Set up desktop due to the lacking of RAM and desk storage of my laptop.

The gene express map has successfully yield last week.

Will try to add probe point according to Lukas suggestion.

And will try to plot the map in d3.(2 days limit, if not possible then give up)

----
#### v2018 -3-28

d3 plots of gene expression seems good, the script has been successfully shows the csv table has transform into svg in HTML

Two job remining at the moment:

* figure out the scale of colorScale

 overlay the tissue image.

 And ask Lukas about the detail demands of interface.
